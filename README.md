# My Flutter Dev Journey

This repo is a collection of apps I create to learn and practice my Dart and Flutter knowledge.

A few resources to get you started if you're beginner just like me:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
